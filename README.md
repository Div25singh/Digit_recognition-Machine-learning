# Digit_recognition-Machine-learning
A popular demonstration of the capability of machine learning techniques is object recognition in data processing.

Digit recognition system is the working of a machine to train itself or recognizing the digits from different sources. Developing such a system includes a machine to understand and classify the images of handwritten digits as 10 digits (0â€“9). The purpose of this project is to recognize the handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the famous MNIST dataset try to achieve near about 100% performance and near-human performance.
